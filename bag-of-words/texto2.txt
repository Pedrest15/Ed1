The bag-of-words model is a way of representing text data when modeling text with machine learning algorithms . The bag-of-words model is simple to understand and implement and has seen great success in problems such as language modeling and document classification . In this tutorial , you will discover the bag-of-words model for feature extraction in natural language processing . After completing this tutorial , you will know : what the bag-of-words model is and why it is needed to represent text ; how to develop a bag-of-words model for a collection of documents ; how to use different techniques to prepare a vocabulary and score words ; kick-start your project with my new book deep learning for natural language processing , including step-by-step tutorials and the Python source code files for all examples . Lets get started . A problem with modeling text is that it is messy , and techniques like machine learning algorithms prefer well defined fixed-length inputs and outputs . The machine learning algorithms cannot work with raw text directly ; the text must be converted into numbers . Specifically , vectors of numbers .
